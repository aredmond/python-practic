# Python Basics Course

The Cloud Platform Team will be holding a four week python basics course (Meets once a week) and invites you to join! The instructor will guide the class through various python challenges while the students work in pairs to complete the challenge. The challenges will be released to a git repository after the class and will serve as the practice martial for that week. Students are expected to go through the challenges until googling and referring to the answers is no longer necessary (3-5 times before the next class). The course will start with the very basics, no programing knowledge is needed to take the course. The beginning course will last 4 weeks and will repeat with a fresh batch of students after completion.

Time: 2:00pm - 3:00pm every Wednesday starting April 10th
