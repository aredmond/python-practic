# Overview

The Cloud Platform Team will be holding a python course every Wednesday at 2:00pm. The instructor will guide the class through various python challenges while the students work in pairs to complete the challenge. The challenges will be released to a git repository after the class and will serve as the practice martial for that week. Students are expected to go through the challenges until googling and referring to the answers is no longer necessary (3-5 times before the next class). The course will start with the very basics, no programing knowledge is needed to take the course. The beginning course will last 4 weeks and will repeat with a fresh batch of students after completion.

# Purpose

The Purpose of this course is to create a python movement at Nu Skin. A python movement at Nu Skin will open up growth opportunities for those learning python. It will also increase productivity and automation efforts on teams less familiar with software development practices. Having a python core competencies on multiple teams will increase points of success (reduce single points of failure). This course will increase collaboration across teams and build relationships between folks that never work together. After taking the basics course you will be primed for more advanced courses and self study. Evangelize python as an automation tool
