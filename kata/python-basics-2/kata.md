# Functions, loops, and ifs Python Kata

## 1. Function Basics

1. Create a empty function
2. Add a return statement
3. Add a argument
4. Add another argument with a default value

## 2. If Basics

1. Define the following
```
a = 24
b = 214
c = 0
```
2. Create a if statement that succeeds after comparing a and b, have it print something on success
3. Add an else if (elif) statement that DOES NOT execute after comparing a and c, have it print something as well.
4. Add an and statement to the if comparison that causes the if to fail (not execute) forcing the elif to be checked.
5. Add an or statement to the elif that will succeed
6. Add and else statement, change the values so that the else block is executed
7. Write an if that checks if the string "cat" is contained in the string "cats in hats".
8. Reverse 6 with a not and check for "bat" vs "cat"
9. Write a one line if else statement

## 3. Looping Basics

1. Write a for loop using the range function and ensure 10 loops occur.
2. Finish the following code with a while loop, insure 10 loops
```
i = 0
## while goes here
    i += 1
    print(i)
```
3. Introduce an if statement that will cause the while to break (stop looping not error) after 3 loops
4. Change the if statement to issue a continue before the print statement for every other loop
