# Python List Comprehension Kata

Here is the big takeaway. Python list compressions are just syntactic sugar around a for loop.

## 1. Simple `for` loops

### Define Some lists

1. Write the definition of a list comprehension in sud code
2. Break the definition down by rewriting it as a normal for loop
3. Expand number 1 and number 2 using conditionals
4. Define a list from 1 to 10
5. Define a list of the squares of 1 to 10
6. Do the same as number 5 but only add the even squares to the list


I will expand this kata to include sushi operators and other hard to understand list concepts.
